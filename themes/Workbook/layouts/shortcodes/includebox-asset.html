{{/* include a "for_students" box (html and js file) that is in assets
     NOT in static - this is better since it can end up in both
     the solution and the regular version

     it uses parameter names to be flexible
     "box" is required

     if there is an "extra" js file - it is assumed to be in the same folder

     set "solution" to the solution name (for html and js) if you want the solution (if we're building the solution)

     this does not do the jsBuild process (since that can mangle the code in bad ways)
